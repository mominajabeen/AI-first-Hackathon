The goal for the AI Agents Hackathon is to chain the 2/3 different prompts in an automated way using one of the following frameworks:
1.	LangChain 
2.	AutoGPT
3.	BabyAGI


The workflow:
1.	Import CSV of (dummy) comments from a Tiktok video
2.	Perform the sentiment analysis on the comments using a bot with ChatGP
3.	Create a table of Titles and Synopsis for the Top 10 Reaction videos using a bot with ChatGPT 
4.	Add two more columns for Script and Hashtags based on the TItle and Synopsis using a bot with ChatGPT


Easy ways of developing the prototype (we can pick 1):
1.	Using an existing Google Collab Notebook with bots for ChatGPT (or other Generative AI APIs)
2.	Develop the backend with ChatGPT API and integrate it with pre-made/existing frontend


Once we have deployed the application then we can make a presentation and demo video to complete the deliverables for the hackathon.
